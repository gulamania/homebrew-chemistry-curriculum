Heyo this is for me. You are welcome to take a look. I'm just making an easier to following curriculum for myself so I can actually understand and test myself as I go on the things I am learning. I am to first cover Orgo and Inorganic at an undergrad level and then nerd out over larger scale chemical engineering (like factory engineering). Specifically I wanna look at medical synthesis and ore processing facilities cause they are soooo cool. This is because I was playing factorio and got mad that it wasn't complex enough. So by the power of the irl chemistry wiki (a series of textbooks I've nicked from the internet) I intend to theorycraft my own factories. Take that factorio.
